  # E-Commerce-Back-End

  ## Description
  This is a back-end e-commerce database site that will allow a manager at an internet retail company use the site with the latest technologies to compete with other e-commerce companies. When the manager adds the database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, the manager is then connected to the database using Sequlize. When the manager enters the schema and seeds the commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data. When the manager enters the commend to invoke the application, then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. When the manager opens API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, then the manager sees the data for each of the routes in formatted JSON. When the manager tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then the manager can successfully create, update, and delete routes in Insomnia. Lastly, the manager is able to successfully create, update, and delete the database.
